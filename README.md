# ECG-Signal-Arrhythmia-Detection
🫀 ECG Signal Arrhythmia Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats) in ECG signals using machine learning and deep learning techniques. We utilized the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to analyze, preprocess, and classify ECG waveforms, aiming to support early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac anomalies.

🔍 Key Features:
Preprocessing of ECG data (handling missing values, standardization)

Signal smoothing and visualization with confidence intervals

Autoencoder-based anomaly detection

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification for heartbeat classification

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset

📊 Results:
Achieved 87% accuracy using KNN on the processed dataset

Successfully reconstructed ECG signals with autoencoders for anomaly detection
